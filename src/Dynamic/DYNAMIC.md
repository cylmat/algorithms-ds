# Dynamic programming

- Optimal substructure: optimal solution constructed from optimal subproblems's solutions
- Overlapping subproblems: broken down into reused subproblems

Sample
---
- Bellman–Ford–Moore (shortest path)
- Damerau–Levenshtein distance
- Floyd–Warshall (shortest path)
- Held–Karp (Traveling salesman problem)
- Hirschberg (sequence alignment between two strings)
- Needleman–Wunsch (bio sequences)
- Smith–Waterman (bio sequences)
- Ruzzo–Tompa (real numbers)

Problems
---
- Knapsack problem
- Matrix chain ordering
- Maximum subarray (Kadane)
- Newsvendor problem
- Shortest common supersequence
- Subset sum

Optimization
---
* Branch & bound (For NP-Complete, A* like)
* Greedy algorithm
  + Method hill-climbing 

- Gradient stochastique
- Ford-Fulkerson (greedy, maximum network flow)
- Linear
  + Karmarkar
  + Simplex
