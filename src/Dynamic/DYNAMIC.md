# Dynamic programming

- Optimal substructure: optimal solution constructed from optimal subproblems's solutions
- Overlapping subproblems: broken down into reused subproblems

Sample
---
- Bellman–Ford–Moore (shortest path)
- Damerau–Levenshtein distance
- Floyd–Warshall (shortest path)
- Held–Karp (Traveling salesman problem)
- Hirschberg (sequence alignment between two strings)
- Needleman–Wunsch (bio sequences)
- Smith–Waterman (bio sequences)
- Ruzzo–Tompa (real numbers)

Problems
---
- Knapsack
- Matrix chain ordering
- Maximum subarray (Kadane)
- Shortest common supersequence
- Subset sum
